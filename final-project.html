            <p class="UserPage"> The User Interviews conducted gave insight into what people think goes on the portfolio website. This helped me establish what belonged on the site and what didn't. For example everyone expected there to be a resume and contact information. They also expected the site to be easy to navigate. </p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> Competitor Analysis involved looking at other portfolios that professionals had done online and analyzing their merits or weaknesses. I chose to analyze professionals in the UX field, because they would have the most visually appealing portfolios. The analysis gave insight into what features I could incorporate into my own site, as well as features that would not work for me.</p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> The feature value matrix is a list of all the current features and functions that could be implemented in future versions of the website. I chose to focus on essential features on the site and a few optional ones. The necessary features involved information that had to be on the site. The optional ones included a pop-up contact button or an almost invisible scroll bar.  </p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> The feature prioritization charts helped me understand what needed to be on the page and what was feasible to complete. The things at the top right had to be completely done, because they were feasible and necessary. The things at the top left were features that had to be implemented at a later date due to the technical efforts involved. The charts give a nice visualization of what can be done easily and what can't, which really helps you decide where to start.</p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> The user stories forced me to get into the midset of people who would use the portfolio website. What hiring managers want to look for and find was essential to coming up with the user stories. They were the main focus and the different reasons for looking through a portfolio made it apparent that information had to be easy to find.</p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> A cognitive walkthrough is a test where the user is being guided and asked questions about the site. It was the most beneficial research I conducted. Guiding people through the site with objectives in mind showed where the site needed to improve clarity and usability. It highlighted what features and function people thought were difficult to use or confusing. </p>

        <section class="colorChange">
            <p class="UserPage"> I chose the click test to see if people wouold know where to go to find my skills and experience. This was the most important feature I wanted to highlight and most people understood that I had placed them in resume. Some clicked in random places, most likely due to not understanding the test properly. I also conducted a test on the picture to see if it was appropriate or not. It was not.</p>

        <h2> Summary of Findings</h2>
        <section class="findings colorChange">
            <p class="findings"> My findings showed that there was not enough information on my site. Through the use of the competitor analysis and walkthroughs, I saw there was a lack of information on all of the pages. The home page had a short paragraph  that was not descript. Some competitors had pictures of their hobbies or simply had an about me for personal information. The people in the walkthroughs also had difficulty in finding personal information a bout myself. They did not even notice the biography and ignored it for the most part. The resume page also lacked some vital information. The competitors all had links or descriptions of their previous projects, rather than just a text resume. This means that I would need to add a new page that specifically talks about my projects and highlights skills used to make them. The contact me page was even more useless. It contains very little informaion and the information it does contain would be better suited somewhere else or in a mail form.</p>
            <p class="findings"> The feature value matrix was incredibly helpful in determining what was not necessary on my page. It made me critically think about all the different features I had and what I needed to add to make the site more appealing. The competitor analysis was also critical in determing what features I wanted to implement. I saw how different people personalized their sites with different features and it gave me ideas to add features to my website. One big thing that I saw was the single page scrolling style that seems like the dominant style. I initially opted out of this style, because I felt the scrolling gets tiring even with a nav bar. After seeing so many competitor sites with this style and using it, I have come to realize that it is definitely worth looking into changing the layout of my site into a scrolling style page.</p>

        <h2> Incorporation of Findings </h2>
        <section class="findings colorChange">
            <p class="findings"> My findings lead to very feasible changes to my portfolio site. Rather than just have my email and OP.GG in the contact page I plan to remove it entirely. It was simply lacking information and instead of the contact page it will simply be a button that opens a pop-up. This pop-up will contain various ways to contact me such as email, facebook, and linked in. I plan to have icons with labels under them for the sake of clarity. I also plan to show my names in certain games such as Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends on the pop-up window. I also plan to include more in the home page, possibly change the name to "About" so it is clearer that this is where my biography is. I plan to add more personal pictures that show off my hobbies and interests. The main picture will also be changed to a more professional picture. </p>
            <p class="findings"> I also plan to redo the resume page entirely. There will be a projects page that will highlight the different projects I have completed. There will be pictures or a video demonstration if applicable. It will be accompanied by a description of the project and the skills I used to complete it. This solutiona became apparent after seeing most competitors have a project section, or some way to show off their projects. The resume  will be more of a pop-up resume with a download button. After viewing competitors I saw the window of the resume inside the website, which I thought looked vastly superior to my own. It would be under the projects tab either at the top or at the bottom. The resume would be have a click to show button as well. </p>
